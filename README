This plugin will allow you to reach a desired location on the visible screen by
performing a sequence of bisections to the left, right, up, and down.  By default,
these are performed using the <C-h>, <C-l>, <C-j>, and <C-k> commands, respectively.
<C-n> cancels a bisect.

For example, suppose your cursor is above the desired location on the screen.  Call
the BisectDown command, and your cursor will move halfway between its current
location and the bottom of the screen.  Now suppose your cursor is below the desired
position.  Call the BisectUp command, and your cursor will move to halfway between
its current position and its original position.  Repeat as necessary.  BisectLeft and
BisectRight work analagously.  Horizontal and vertical commands can be interleaved.

Works in normal and all visual modes.

Note that the github repo is slightly more up to date.  (Switching to visual mode cancels a bisect).  I swear I'll get around to updating the vimball soon.
