This plugin will allow you to reach a desired location on the visible screen by
performing a sequence of bisections to the left, right, up, and down.  By default,
these are performed using the <C-h>, <C-l>, <C-j>, and <C-k> commands, respectively.
<C-i> cancels a bisect.

Horizontal and vertical commands can be interleaved.

Works in normal and all visual modes.
